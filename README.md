The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around a grid, eating food to grow longer. The objective is to avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the game boundaries. This implementation is written in Java using the javax.swing package for the graphical user interface.

Features
Grid-based Gameplay:

The game is played on a grid where the snake and food are represented as squares.
The snake grows longer each time it consumes food.
Directional Controls:

The player can control the snake's direction using the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
Collision Detection:

The game checks for collisions with the snake's own body and the boundaries of the grid.
Game Over Display:

A game over message is displayed when the snake collides with itself or goes out of bounds.
